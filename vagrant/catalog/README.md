# Soccer Catalog Web App
 
## Intro

This web app displays soccer players from various teams. It uses Google OAuth authentication, allows user to add/edit/delete player information, and maintains a public and login interface. 

We're using tools called [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) to install and manage the VM. 

## Installation

### Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. [You can download it from virtualbox.org, here.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) Install the _platform package_ for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

Currently (October 2017), the supported version of VirtualBox to install is version 5.1. Newer versions do not work with the current release of Vagrant.

**Ubuntu users:** If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center instead. Due to a reported bug, installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.

### Install Vagrant

Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. [Download it from vagrantup.com.](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) Install the version for your operating system.

**Windows users:** The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.

_If Vagrant is successfully installed, you will be able to run_ `vagrant --version`
_in your terminal to see the version number._
_The shell prompt in your terminal may differ. Here, the_ `$` _sign is the shell prompt._

## Instructions

### Start the virtual machine

From your terminal, inside the **vagrant** subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

_Starting the Ubuntu Linux installation with `vagrant up`._
_This screenshot shows just the beginning of many, many pages of output in a lot of colors._

When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!

_Logging into the Linux VM with `vagrant ssh`._

### Logged in

If you are now looking at a shell prompt that starts with the word `vagrant` (as in the above screenshot), congratulations â€” you've gotten logged into your Linux VM.

### Running the App

After you have `vagrant ssh`, `cd` to directory `/vagrant/catalog` and run `python models.py` to build the database model. Then run the application with `python application.py`. 

### Web App on Browser

Open web browser to `http://localhost:5000/main` to see the app. There should be pre-loaded data on the main page to get started.

## Using the Web App

Logged-in user (with Google OAuth) will be able to create/edit/delete soccer players that they have added. Non-logged in user will be able to able to view the soccer players but not make any modification. 

The app comes loaded with soccer players from 4 soccer teams.
